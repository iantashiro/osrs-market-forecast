## 📈 OSRS Bond Price Predictor
A time series forecasting project using Facebook Prophet to model and predict the price of Bonds in the Old School RuneScape (OSRS) Grand Exchange.

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project is my first end-to-end data science project built completely from scratch — from data collection and cleaning, through exploratory data analysis, to forecast modeling and evaluation. It serves as a portfolio piece to showcase my understanding of time series forecasting and practical model development. Feedback is welcome!

## 📦 What’s Inside
📊 Data Collection: Automated daily price data collected from the OSRS Grand Exchange API.

🧹 Preprocessing: Cleaning, log-transforming, and formatting time series data.

🔍 Exploratory Analysis: Visualizations of trends, seasonality, and outliers.

📈 Modeling with Prophet.

🧪 Evaluation: Comparison of predicted vs. actual prices using RMSE & MAPE.

📉 Uncertainty Analysis: Interpreting forecast confidence intervals.


## 🧠 Why Prophet?
Prophet is great for business-style time series with multiple seasonalities and changepoints.

Automatically handles trend, weekly/monthly/yearly cycles, and missing values.

Simple to tune and interpret — ideal for a first forecasting project.
